A plugin that can be used to audit every region in a Minecraft server
This is primarily developed for use in BTE (Build The Earth), but may be used in other servers, subject to license terms.

Notes:
-When first using the command '/reloaddatabase' must be executed, or errors will occur when trying to use the other commands
  -This also applies after a '/resetdatabase' is executed
-Make sure to read the descriptions in the 'plugin.yaml' file
-This is a completely manual plugin, and for large servers, it may take a while for all regions to be audited by server staff members

Warnings:
-It is strongly recommended against running '/reloaddatabase' on large servers when there are large volumes of players online.
-This is my first proper large-scale plugin, so errors/bugs are expected; use this plugin at your own risk.
